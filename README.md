# Turing Machine, C

This is a turing machine that is built in C that was built for the final of 408

## Installation


## Usage


## Project Executive Summary
### Describe the Problem
In computer science theory, the turing machine serves as an important mathematical model or concept. There is a problem in the computer science theory called the halting problem. The halting problem asks whether or not you can write a program that can predict if another program will freeze or not. This is a very hard problem to solve because the halting problem includes an infinite amount of programs. What the turing machine did was create something with a "infinite" tape.
 
 ### Process to Solve the Problem
 1. Create the standards are practices for the code itself.
 2. Create some sort of diagram to help me depict what the actual program might look like
 3. Implement the diagram and use it to create the turing machine in C
 
### Proposed Solution
The problem is that the turing machine is a great invention that serves a huge purpose in the computer mathematics theory. I would like to personally try to get a working turing machine in C, so I can further my understanding of computers. Creating this machine would not only further help my understanding of the turing machine itself, but will serve as a learning experience. 
 
### Expected Deliverables
 - Design that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
 - Documentation that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
 - A fully operational codebase that serves as a basic turing machine.

## How Documentation Will Be Done
Everything is to be done in `.md` files unless there is reason to use another format (e.g. diagrams).
