# Turing Machine, C

This github serves as the repository of a turing machine that is built into the C language.

## Installation


## Usage
```bash
Linux
gcc c_turing_machine.c -o p && ./p

Windows
cl c_turing_machine.c && c_turing_machine.exe

Mac
gcc c_turing_machine.c -o p && ./p

Note: Before doing any of these, please make sure to go to the directory that the file is in using cd.
```


## Project Executive Summary
### Describe the Problem
In computer science theory, the turing machine serves as an important mathematical model or concept. There is a problem in the computer science theory called the halting problem. The halting problem asks whether or not you can write a program that can predict if another program will freeze or not. This is a very hard problem to solve because the halting problem includes an infinite amount of programs. What the turing machine did was create something with a "infinite" tape.
 
 ### Process to Solve the Problem
 1. Create the standards are practices for the code itself.
 2. Create some sort of diagram to help me depict what the actual program might look like
 3. Implement the diagram and use it to create the turing machine in C
 
### Proposed Solution
The problem is that the turing machine is a great invention that serves a huge purpose in the computer mathematics theory. I would like to personally try to get a working turing machine in C, so I can further my understanding of computers. Creating this machine would not only further help my understanding of the turing machine itself, but will serve as a learning experience. 
 
### Expected Deliverables
 - Design that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
 - Documentation that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
 - A fully operational codebase that serves as a basic turing machine.

### Coding Standards and Practices
<pre>
◆ Every procedural program or driver must use a main method. <br />
◆ Main methods must be at the top of your code file. <br />
◆ Global variables are unacceptable. <br />
◆ Programs should be broken into functions where possible. <br />
◆ Functions should have less than 20 lines if possible. <br />
◆ All functions should be well defined. <br />
◆ All function should be testable. <br />
◆ All code should be self-documenting. <br />
◆ All OOP code must stringently follow OOP best practices. <br />
◆ UML design for OOP is expected. <br />
◆ Conventional Data Structure designs must be used if possible. <br />
◆ Submissions should have no compiler or interpreter errors <br />
</pre>

## How Documentation Will Be Done
Everything is to be done in `.md` files unless there is reason to use another format (e.g. diagrams).
